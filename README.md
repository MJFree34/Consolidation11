# MatchedPairs

MatchedPairs is a Memory or Concentration card game made completely in Swift. It was started as Paul Hudson's final Consolidation project, number 11, but became bigger.

## Includes
- Unit and UI Testing
- UICollectionViews
- Custom designs from Figma
- (Attempted) MVC architecture
- Programmatic UI

This is my attempt at a true iOS app, and will be published in Testflight at a later time. Thank you!
